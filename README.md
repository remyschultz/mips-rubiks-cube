# MIPS Assembly Rubik's Cube  

This is a school project for Assembly Language & Computer Architecture from Fall 2020 written in MIPS assembly. The program scrambles a Rubik's Cube and times the user's solve. The cube is displayed using ASCII characters, and moves are entered using [standard move notation](http://www.rubiksplace.com/move-notations/).
